# GenAIProjects

Welcome to **GenAIProjects** â€“ a collection of hands-on projects exploring various applications of **Generative AI (GenAI)**.

This repository is designed to showcase practical implementations, experiments, and use cases of GenAI technologies.

## Motivation

Generative AI is revolutionizing the way we interact with machines, create content, and solve problems. This repository aims to:

- Apply state-of-the-art GenAI models to real-world tasks
- Build end-to-end GenAI systems (e.g., agents, chatbots, tools)
- Experiment with open-source and proprietary models

## Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository contains a standalone project.
